  title: German Trusted List of DSCs
  description: >-
    This endpoint provides access to the List of Document Signing Certificates (DSCs) that Germany considers authorized to sign Digital Green Certificates (DGCs). The list gets periodially updated with the latest list from the [EU Gateway](https://eu-digital-green-certificates.github.io/dgc-gateway/). The data structure of the response is similar to the response from the Gateway - however we add an additional signature of the overall list to ensure authenticity and integrity.

    This is also why this is a plain text response: the first line contains the signature, the second line the actual content, a JSON object of DSC entries.
