      summary: Re-issue a new certificate based on an existing valid certificate.

        # Description

        Re-issue a new certificate based on an existing valid certificate. This operation verifies the authenticity and
        the integrity of the certificate, checks some formal rules of the content of the certificate and re-issues
        a new certificate with a different validity and/or re-encoded specifics (i.e. series encoding) than the original
        certificate.

        *Applications:* mobile applications, wallet apps
